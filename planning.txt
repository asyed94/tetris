GAME FLOW
=========

On each time step:
  1-Move gravitized blocks down
  OR
  1-Remove filled rows
  OR
  1-Drop a new piece

  2-Check conditions and set gravity on remaining blocks
    2a-Check conditions on all blocks[], set gravity accordingly.
    2b-Check conditions on currentPiece.blocks[], set gravity accordingly.
