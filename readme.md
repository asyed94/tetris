# tetris
My version of the age old classic. Made using the [Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser "Phaser") framework.

## Dependencies: ##

- [Mongoose Web Server](https://www.cesanta.com/products/binary)

## How to Run: ##

1. Download the `mongoose.exe` binary from the link above.
2. Copy the binary into the `/tetris` folder.
3. Run `mongoose.exe`. (Firewall/Anti-Vius might complain; its a standalone web server.)
4. Once `mongoose.exe` is running, open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/tetris.html`.
